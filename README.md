## Oi Hello there! 🚀✨👋🏼

### This is a simple User Authentication and Profile Dashboard created using [Next.js](https://www.nextjs.org/)!

🎉 These are the current features:
- Login & Registration
- OTP Message Verification
- Profile Dashboard Editing

If you wanna play around with this simple overview, this is how you run the development server:

```bash
npm run proxy # or yarn proxy
* running on PORT 8010
```
then
```bash
npm run dev # or yarn dev
* running on PORT 3000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
You should also totally modify and improve what I've already built! 🦾


## 🔨 Resources

I used [http://pretest-qa.dcidev.id/](http://pretest-qa.dcidev.id/documentation/v1) API for this project. I also used [```local-cors-proxy```](https://github.com/garmeeh/local-cors-proxy) as a simple proxy to bypass CORS issues.

To learn more about the stacks I used, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - Next.js features and API.
- [React Query Documentation](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/overview) - Server state and cache management data-fetching library.
- [Material UI Documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) - Material UI for components and styling.
